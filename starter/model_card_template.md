paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf
## Model Details
- We used a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn in this project
- For more information about the model, please refer to Udacity Nanodegree program
## Intended Use
- This project is intended to show an example of deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production using FastAPI and Heroku.
- Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data
## Training Data
- Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.
- Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.
- More information at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income
- We have used 80% of the original dataset for the training purposes of the model.
## Evaluation Data
- We have used 20% of the original dataset for evaluation purposes of the model.
## Metrics
- We have used three metrics in this project; fbeta_score, precision_score and recall_score.
- Our model's performance is:
  - Fbeta_score: 0.67327
  - Precision_score: 0.72801
  - Recall_score: 0.62619

## Ethical Considerations
- One ethical consideration we need to think of is the high performance metrics when evaluating on slices of the data, 
while the performance is much lower when evaluating on the whole test set.
- In addition, validation on slices of the data shows that for those people that are without-pay of have never worked,
the model achieves the highest performance on classifying wether those people have income below or higher than 50K.
## Caveats and Recommendations
- The performance of the model can be improved using either more advanced classifiers or by implementing hyperparameter tuning.
